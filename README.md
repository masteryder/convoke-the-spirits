## Convoke the spirits
A small app to simulate what the card can do in different scenarios.

This is for standard mode only, I didn't want to code every druid spell in the game

### Shortcuts I took

- The app doesn't care about hand / deck size or cards in hand / deck
- There are no minion types
- Cards can have keywords such as "rush" multiple times

For most of the cards I coded what the card does, but some others had to be simplified.
Here are some of the simplified examples:

- Heart of the Wild: Doesn't ever give the  +1/+1 bonus to all beasts effect
- Aquatic Form: Counts always as drawing you 1 card
